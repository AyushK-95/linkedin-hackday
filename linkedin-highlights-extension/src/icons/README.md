# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Design

The icons should represent the LinkedIn Highlights concept with:
- Professional/clean design
- Blue gradient colors matching the app theme
- Simple, recognizable symbol (e.g., lightbulb, chart, or "LH" initials)
- Good contrast for visibility

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
2. Online icon generators
3. Converting from SVG to PNG at different sizes

## Placeholder Icons

For development, you can use simple colored squares or download free icons from:
- Material Design Icons
- Feather Icons
- Heroicons

Make sure to create all four sizes for proper extension functionality.
